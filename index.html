      <h2>About me:</h2>My name is Shreya Aggarwal. I'm a junior at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, CA. I live in a family of five with two younger siblings who look up to me for guidance. Currently, I'm studying for the SAT's and I'm attending a program called Girls Who Code. I'm very interested in computer science and would love to make this my career in the future.
